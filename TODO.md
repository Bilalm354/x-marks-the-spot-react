First prototype - X marks the spot game, state is local. 
[x] Create cards, ' ' or 'X'
[ ] repeat in grid - One of these should be an X and the rest should be an empty space 
[ ] create a flip function for all cards to be flipped 
[ ] function to flip a card onClick that will reveal whether the card was empty or the X 
[ ] if the flipped card was X, Win, else lose and try again 

Second Prototype - State is not local and in a database. When someone wins the game is over and you can no longer play.
